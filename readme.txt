This is the MP1 submission for Abhishek Harish, netId harish2. 
I am a student in 3 credit hour section. 

I made the I for the extra credit and made it in 15 points. 

I did the MP in xCode, so I am not submitting the executable file, but in the archive you will find the source code and my main.cpp file. 

The instruction to run the program are following ;

'q' quits the window.
'a' draws the 'I' in just the wireframe.
's' draws a solid filled 'I'. 
Both 'a' and 's' have animation enabled in them by default.

The link of the video for my animation and 'I' is :

The main function sets up the basic openGL and GLUT environment.
The keyboard function controls the keyboard for the window.
The timer function is called with the value of 33, which means that it creates 30 frames per second.
The display solidFunction displays the ‘I’ in solid filled animation.
The displayFan function displays the ‘I’ in a wireframe.
